Create a class called IntegerSet. Each object of class IntegerSet can hold integers in the range 0
through 10. A set is represented internally as an array of ones and zeros. Array element a[i] is 1 if
integer i is in the set. Array element a[j] is 0 if integer j is not in the set. The default constructor
initializes a set to the so-called “empty-set”. The IntegerSet class should contain a constructor and 5
member functions. The definitions of the functions are as follow:
- unionOfIntegerSets member function that creates a third set which is the set-theoretic union of two
existing sets (an element of the third set’s array is set to 1 if that element is 1 in either or both of the
existing sets, and an element of the third set’s array is set to 0 if that elements is 0 in each of the
existing sets)
- insertElement member function that inserts a new integer k into a set (by setting a[k] to1).
- deleteElement member function that deletes integer m (by setting a[m] to 0).
- print member function that prints a set as a list of numbers separated by spaces. Print only those
elements that are present in the set. Print --- for an empty set.
- isEqualTo member function that determines if two sets are equal.
IntegerSet.h is as follow.
